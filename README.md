Data Mining I project report (Academic Year 2023/2024)

## Data Understanding & Preparation  
- Data semantics description of variables meaning and characteristics  
- Variable distribution statistical analysis and visualization  
- Data quality assessment identification of errors outliers missing values inconsistencies  
- Variable transformations analysis of possible transformations such as log transformation  
- Correlation matrix analysis and possible removal of redundant variables  

## Clustering  
- Centroid-based clustering K-Means Bisecting K-Means X-Means choice of attributes and best k value  
- Density-based clustering DBSCAN OPTICS choice of attributes and best parameter configuration  
- Hierarchical clustering choice of attributes distance function dendrogram analysis  
- Final discussion best algorithm selection based on statistical measures cluster distribution and algorithm type  

## Classification  
- Classification of at least one target variable using Decision Trees KNN Naive Bayes  
- Feature selection and parameter tuning gain criterion for trees best k for KNN etc  
- Performance evaluation confusion matrix accuracy precision recall F1-score ROC curve  
- Model interpretation insights from decision trees and overall best algorithm discussion  

## Pattern Mining and Regression  
- Frequent pattern extraction analysis of pattern variations with different support values  
- Association rule extraction analysis of rules with different confidence values  
- Interpretation of extracted rules and possible applications such as handling missing values or predicting target variables  
- Regression analysis using two or more continuous variables testing different models linear ridge lasso decision tree KNN
